# Assembly: Documentation, Libraries, and Comparison of MIPS and ARM ISAs


## Goals:
   1. To provide a collection of documents[^1] related to both the MIPS and the ARM ISA.

   1. To provide additional documentation providing a comparison between the two ISAs.

   1. To provide exemplar implementations of a subset of the C standard library.  Three such implementations are (to be) provided:
      1. C Code (used as a reference source)
      1. MIPS Assembly Code
      1. Arm Assembly Code

   1. To provide a set of assembly code to be used within assembly projects
      * The SPIM and MARS simulator provide support for OS calls, but do not provide a library of standard subroutines (e.g., \<string.h\>) written in MIPS.

   1. To serve as a vehicle to compare the MIPS and ARM ISA.

[^1]: possible published else.

## Status:
   * Under initial development

## Scope:
   * Current focus is on developing C and MIPS code for the basic routines
   * These routines are focused on memory and string operations
